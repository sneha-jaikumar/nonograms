# Nonograms

In this project, I applied skills from my software fundamentals class to create a GUI implementation of the single-player logic puzzle **nonograms** using the **model-view-controller** design pattern together with the **JavaFX** UI library.

This assignment uses Maven as a build manager, and JavaFX as a GUI library.
